# Forge Personal Website Crash Course Using Github Pages

This repository holds the information from the Forge Personal Website Crash Course on April 18, 2021 (https://forgecc-githubpages.splashthat.com). To quote the description from the course: 
> Have you ever wanted to build a personal website but didn’t know where to start? Now’s your chance. By the end of this interactive crash course, you’ll come out with your very own webpage on the Internet for others to see your projects and who you are. Along the way, you’ll pick up invaluable skills of version control with Git as well as web development with HTML and CSS.
